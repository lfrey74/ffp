# FROST FATHER PHOTOGRAPHY

#### Description

This project is the final project of the CSS portion of
The Odin Project. Customization was allowed in the instructions,
so I decided to make a beginning page for my photography.

#### Copyright Information

All images included in the design are my personal property and
are therefore considered under personal copyright. Images are
watermarked to discourage unauthorized redistribution or claiming.
The design of the page and its associated css are free to use.

#### Page Start and Process

This page will begin construction on August 21, 2024. A basic html
outline with needed placeholders will be completed first. A css
file will be built next to arrange the page per the expected design
outcome image provided by The Odin Project. Images will be added
after the page meets the expected design outcome.

#### Page Completion

Version 1 completed on 8/22/24. This may be the final version
unless future assignments include updating and/or changing this
page.
